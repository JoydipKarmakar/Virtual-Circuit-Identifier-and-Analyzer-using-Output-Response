## Objective

### Purpose of the Software Tool

- The tool aims to accept voltage output data over time or frequency, which can be sourced from simulations or experiments.

- It will analyze the waveform to identify the type of analog circuit, such as RC, RL, or RLC.

- The software will estimate the values of circuit components, including resistance, capacitance, and inductance.

- An optional feature will allow for the display of a schematic or block diagram of the identified circuit.

## Tools & Technologies

### Programming Languages and Libraries

- The preferred programming language for this project is Python, although MATLAB can also be used.

- Essential libraries include:

	- NumPy for numerical operations.

	- SciPy for scientific computing and optimization.

	- Matplotlib for data visualization.

	- Tkinter or PyQt for developing a graphical user interface (GUI).

	- Scikit-learn can be optionally used for machine learning applications.

### Data Input and Output

- The tool will accept data through:

	- Manual entry of time and voltage vectors.

	- Loading from CSV or text files containing time and voltage data.

- The expected output will include:

	- Graphs of the analyzed waveforms.

	- Predicted circuit type.

	- Estimated values for resistance, inductance, and capacitance.

## System Workflow

### Step-by-Step Process

- The system will follow a structured workflow:

	- User inputs data either manually or through file upload.

	- Signal preprocessing will clean and prepare the data for analysis.

	- Curve fitting or system identification will be performed to match the data to known circuit models.

	- The circuit type will be classified based on the fitted model.

	- Component value estimation will derive the values of R, L, and C from the identified circuit type.

	- Finally, results will be visualized and can be exported for further use.

## Supported Circuit Types

### Circuit Behavior and Characteristics

- The tool will initially support the following circuit types:

	- RC Circuit: Expected to show an exponential rise or decay in voltage.

	- RL Circuit: Similar to RC but characterized by a linear rise with inductor kickback.

	- RLC Circuit (Series): Anticipated to exhibit damped oscillations.

	- RLC Circuit (Parallel): Expected to demonstrate a resonant response.

## Mathematical Modeling

### Circuit Response Equations

- The software will utilize mathematical models to describe the expected output for each circuit type:

	- RC Circuit Step Response: V(t) = V0(1 - e^(-t/RC))

	- RL Circuit Step Response: I(t) = V0/R(1 - e^(-Rt/L))

	- RLC Circuit (Underdamped Response): V(t) = Ae^(-αt)cos(ωdt + φ)

## Example Python Code

### RC Circuit Detection Implementation

- A sample Python code snippet demonstrates how to detect an RC circuit:

	- Simulated step response data is generated with noise to mimic real-world conditions.

	- A model function is defined to fit the data using curve fitting techniques.

	- The estimated RC value is extracted and plotted against the measured output for visual validation.

## Component Value Estimation Logic

### Analyzing Detected Shapes

- The software will analyze the shape of the output signal to determine the circuit type and extract parameters:

	- Exponential Shape: Fits the RC model to extract the RC value.

	- Oscillatory Shape: Fits the underdamped RLC model to extract damping and natural frequency, which can be used to derive R, L, and C values.

	- Linear Ramp: Analyzes the slope to identify RL behavior.

## Advanced Add-ons (Optional)

### Enhancements for User Experience

- The project may include optional advanced features:

	- A GUI developed with Tkinter or PyQt that allows users to upload waveform files, view plots in real-time, and save results as PDF reports.

	- Machine learning-based classification where a model is trained on synthetic data to predict circuit types based on time series output.

## Deliverables

### Expected Outputs from the Project

- The final deliverables will include:

	- A Python-based executable or script for the tool.

	- An optional GUI for enhanced user interaction.

	- A sample dataset in CSV format containing simulated circuit data.

	- Comprehensive documentation and usage instructions for end-users.

## Next Steps

### Future Development Plans

- The project will begin with the detection of RC circuits, followed by the addition of RL and RLC circuit types.

- Development of the GUI will be considered as an optional enhancement.

- Future iterations may also include support for frequency-domain input, such as sine sweep data, to broaden the tool's applicability.
