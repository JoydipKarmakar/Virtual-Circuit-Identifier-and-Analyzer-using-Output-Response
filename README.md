# Virtual Circuit Identifier and Analyzer

This project is a prototype for identifying and analyzing electronic circuits based on their simulated output response. It consists of a simple Python Flask backend and a static HTML/CSS/JS frontend.

**Note:** The backend currently contains mock logic for circuit simulation and analysis. It does not perform actual circuit simulations or machine learning inference.
